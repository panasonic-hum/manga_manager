# Goal

The goal of this project is to create a manga tracker to keep up with reading progress and personal collection status. This project is still a work in progress.  

## Tasks to be done

 - ~~Export my currently reading, completed, and to be read from MAL.~~ Got the unofficial API to accomplish this from [this helpful site.](https://malscraper.azurewebsites.net/)
- Setup a database to hold MAL lists
- Build a backend API using [Jikan Python wrapper](https://github.com/abhinavk99/jikanpy) for any information that needs to be fetched from MAL about the manga
- Build a frontend to build the functionality of marking chapters and volumes as read
